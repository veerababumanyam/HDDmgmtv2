## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- Uses `useMemo` for expensive calculations (filtered reports, statistics)
- Efficient filtering with single-pass algorithms
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

### Data Flow
1. Loads all reports from master data via `getDeliveryReports()`
2. Calculates statistics based on selected date range
3. Applies search and filter criteria
4. Updates UI reactively with useMemo hooks
5. Detail dialogs fetch filtered subsets on demand

### Components Used
- **DashboardLayout**: Consistent layout wrapper
- **Card Components**: Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent
- **Form Components**: Input, Label, Select, Button
- **Table Components**: Table, TableHeader, TableBody, TableRow, TableHead, TableCell
- **Dialog Components**: Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription
- **Icons**: Lucide React (TrendingUp, CheckCircle2, Clock, AlertCircle, Package, Eye, etc.)
- **Badge**: Color-coded status indicators
- **StatusBadge**: Interactive status management

## Usage Guide

### Viewing Reports
1. Navigate to Reports page
2. Default view shows current month's data
3. Four stat cards display key metrics
4. Click any card to see detailed breakdown

### Changing Date Range
1. Use the "Date Range" dropdown to select a preset period
2. Or select "Custom Range" and pick specific dates
3. Statistics and revenue update automatically
4. Click "Clear" to reset custom range

### Filtering & Searching
1. Use search box to find specific records
2. Filter by status (Pending/In Progress/Completed)
3. Filter by delivery mode
4. All filters work together with date range

### Exporting Data
1. **Export All**: Click "Export CSV" button in main table
2. **Export Details**: Click any stat card, then "Export to CSV" in dialog
3. Files saved with automatic naming (includes date)

## Business Logic

### Revenue Calculation
```
Revenue = Sum of estimatedAmount 
          WHERE status = 'completed' 
          AND date BETWEEN dateFrom AND dateTo
```

### Date Range Logic
- **Month**: First day of current month to today
- **Quarter**: First day of current quarter to today
- **Year**: January 1st of current year to today
- **Custom**: User-specified from/to dates

### Status Determination
Uses master record data priority:
1. Hard Disk record status (if set)
2. Outward record status
3. Inward record status
4. Derived from record state
