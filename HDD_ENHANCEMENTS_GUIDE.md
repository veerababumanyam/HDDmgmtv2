## üìù Date Format Guide

### Understanding Date Handling

#### Internal Storage (ISO Format)
- **Format**: `yyyy-mm-dd` (e.g., `2025-01-07`)
- **Why**: HTML5 date inputs require this format
- **Usage**: All date fields store in ISO format

#### Display Format (Indian Format)
- **Format**: `dd/mm/yyyy` (e.g., `07/01/2025`)
- **Why**: Familiar to Indian users
- **Usage**: All date displays in table and dialogs

#### Helper Functions
```typescript
getTodayISO()              // Returns today in yyyy-mm-dd
convertISOToDDMMYYYY()     // Convert yyyy-mm-dd to dd/mm/yyyy
formatDateToDDMMYYYY()     // Format Date object to dd/mm/yyyy
```

### Date Fields Summary

| Field | Required | Default | Format Display | Editable |
|-------|----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| HDD Received Date | Yes | Today | dd/mm/yyyy | Yes |
| Estimated Delivery Date | No | Today | dd/mm/yyyy | Yes |
| Delivery Date (dialog) | Yes | Today | dd/mm/yyyy | Yes |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Date shows as yyyy-mm-dd instead of dd/mm/yyyy
**Solution**: Check if using `convertISOToDDMMYYYY()` function. Date inputs need conversion for display.

#### Issue: Customer name not defaulting to company name
**Solution**: Ensure company name is set in Settings page. Check `useCompany()` hook is working.

#### Issue: Delivery dialog validation not working
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields filled. If courier mode, tracking number and company are required.

#### Issue: Closed records still visible
**Solution**: Click "Show Closed" button to hide them. Default view hides closed records.

#### Issue: Can't edit closed record
**Solution**: This is by design. Closed records are locked. Delete and recreate if needed.

#### Issue: Dates not persisting
**Solution**: Check browser localStorage is enabled. Clear cache and try again.
